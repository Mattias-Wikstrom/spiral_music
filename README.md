## Purpose
This HTML page is useful for exploring music-theoretic concepts.

## Guide
Clicking at different points will cause notes of different frequencies to be played in such a way that the frequency of the note that is played corresponds to its distance from the center. Doubling the distance from the center will double the pitch.

By only clicking on the spiral, you can also think of each frequency as having a corresponding angle. Doubling the frequency will, however, give you the same angle that you started with. This corresponds to how frequencies work in music: Doubling the frequency gives you the 'same' note, only an octave higher. For example, 440 Hz gives you an A and 880 Hz will also give you an A.

More generally, two notes will harmonize when their frequencies stand in a simple fractional relationship to each other. For example, one may start with the frequency 520 Hz, representing the note C and then multiply with 3/2 to get the frequency 780 Hz, representing the note G. These two frequencies will accordingly sound fine when played together.

Multiplying 520 Hz by 4/3 similarly gives one 693 Hz, representing the note F.

The notes C, F, and G are all fundamental to the C major tonality. To get a full C major scale, play the following notes by clicking at points on the spiral: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.
